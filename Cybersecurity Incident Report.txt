Cybersecurity Incident Report
Summary of the Problem
The tcpdump log reveals that a DNS (Domain Name System) resolution failure occurred when attempting to access www.yummyrecipesforme.com. The log shows:

A UDP packet (DNS query) was sent to the DNS server (203.0.113.2) on port 53 to resolve the domain name.

The server responded with an ICMP error message: "udp port 53 unreachable", indicating that the DNS service was not available.

Three attempts were made, but all failed with the same error.

Analysis & Possible Cause
Affected Protocol: DNS (UDP port 53)

The DNS server did not respond to UDP requests, preventing domain resolution.

The ICMP error confirms that the DNS service was unreachable.

Possible Cause:

DNS Server Misconfiguration (e.g., DNS service not running on port 53).

Firewall Blocking UDP/53 (preventing DNS queries from reaching the server).

Network Outage (DNS server may be down or unreachable).

Next Steps
Verify if the DNS service is running on the server.

Check firewall rules to ensure UDP/53 is not blocked.

Confirm network connectivity between the client and DNS server.
